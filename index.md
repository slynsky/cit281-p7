## Project Purpose and Components
As opposed to a coding task, project 7 required students to create a portfolio of their work using GitHub pages.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I grew much more comfortable using the GitHub interface and specifically GitHub Pages. It helped my problem solving skills, and I felt like I was really figuring things out for myself as I went.
